# Etch-a-Sketch

This project will create the basics of the Etch A Sketch that will test my
abilities in using DOM.

Project Reflection: This project is definitely one of my hardest projects
I have worked on so far. Took a lot of time and research to finally understand
that I just needed to use flex flow to ensure the rows and square boxes
do not go beyond the container width and height. I also should commit
more messages whenever I create a new method.
